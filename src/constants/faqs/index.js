      After the requested pickup time,
      there will be a 30-minute FREE waiting time at the airport. Our driver will be
      waiting for you in the arrivals hall, with an 'Airport Pickups' name board with your name on it.
      They will then accompany you to the vehicle. If you realize that you will not be able to meet the driver
      within the 30 minutes, then if you contact us, we will hold the driver in the terminal at the below-shown cost.
      For example, if your flight lands at 10:00 am,
      and you have requested your pickup time to be 60 minutes after the flight landing time; our driver will be in the
      terminal at 11 am. The driver will wait till 11:30 am FREE of charge. After this time, the below charges will apply:

      <table>
       <tr>
