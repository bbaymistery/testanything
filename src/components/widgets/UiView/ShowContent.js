                Traveling to/from
                Heathrow Airport? The transfer fare
                is cheaper than you might imagine.
                Heathrow taxis
                reliable than public transport, more often than not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each year, more than 70 million passengers pass through Heathrow
                Airport, making it the busiest international airport in the UK and
                the third busiest in the world, after Beijing and Atlanta.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are five main terminals at  Heathrow. Our transfer fares
                from Central London are starting from £60.00, regardless of
                which terminal you are departing from. Meanwhile, transfer from
                Heathrow Airport to Central London  (again, from any terminal)
                are charged at £65.00. All  Heathrow transfer prices are
                inclusive.
            </p>

                <br /> If you are looking for a cheap Heathrow Airport transfer
                quote, look no further. All our fares include 30 minutes’ waiting
                time, airport meet and greet, parking, tolls, and taxes, as
                standard. Furthermore, if you happen to be traveling with small
                children, child seats are provided at no extra cost. Our
                all-inclusive Heathrow transfer prices come with no
                unexpected surprises or hidden extras. <br /> Heathrow Car Service's
                office is located just outside the airport’s perimeter, making us
                the closest minicab company to the airport itself: we’re just two
                minutes from Terminal 2; 3 minutes from Terminal 4; and 10 minutes
                from Terminal 5. This is just one of the reasons Heathrow Car
                Service is able to provide such cheap fares to/from Heathrow
                Airport.

                <br /> Traveling between terminals at Heathrow Airport? Minicab
                is an alternative to the often-crowded terminal shuttle trains. It’s
                also a great option for passengers with small children or
                walking/mobility issues. An altogether more civilized way to
                navigate your way around the airport, Heathrow Car
                Service’s inter-terminal transfers cost just £18. Please
                contact us for further information.

                <br /> One of the big worries when traveling with infants or small
                children is whether you’ll even be able to take a minicab to
                Heathrow Airport, without lugging along your own car
                seat. Heathrow Car Service is one of the few minicab companies
                to offer complimentary, age-appropriate baby/child seats for your
                journey with us at no additional cost. To avail of this service, you
                will need to pre-book your Heathrow private car and advise of the
                age(s) of your child(ren).
