        Picture the scene: you are transferring&nbsp;between terminals at
        Heathrow Airport. Your incoming flight was delayed and you have much
        shorter window than originally hoped to make it to the gate to catch
        your next flight. Then you realise the flight is departing from another
        terminal! You could negotiate the crowds with heavy luggage (and perhaps
        children in tow), wait 15 minutes for the transfer shuttle and make a
        mad dash to security, stress levels through the roof. Or you could do
        your homework pre-departure, figure our whether a change in terminal is
        required and pre-book a&nbsp;Heathrow inter-terminal
        minicab&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;with&nbsp;Heathrow Car Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        For just £18, you could be coasting through the airport in comfort and
        with ample time to spare. Our&nbsp;between terminal transfers at
        Heathrow&nbsp;are a cost effective alternative to public transportation
        options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel times&nbsp;between terminals at Heathrow&nbsp;are as follows
        (approximately):
      </p>
      <p>
        T2 to T3 – 10 minutes’ walk <br /> T2/T3 to T4 – 20 minutes via shuttle
        train. <br /> All terminals to T5 – 20 minutes on the Heathrow Express.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>NB. T1 &amp; T2 are located together.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        London Underground trains also operate between the terminals, with an
        average journey time of 16 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have limited mobility or a tight turnaround time between flights,
        eliminate transit travel delays and stress by opting for a&nbsp;Heathrow
        inter-terminal minicab. As with all&nbsp;Heathrow transfer services, our
        minicabs between terminals at Heathrow&nbsp;Airport&nbsp;include meet
        and greet service. Our prices are competitive and we offer a ‘no hidden
        extras’ guarantee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flat-rate&nbsp;cost for an inter-terminal minicab at
        Heathrow&nbsp;is just £19, all-inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heathrow Car Service is able to offer such competitive fares as we
        specialise in airport minicabs. What’s more, our offices are located
        right beside Heathrow Airport.
