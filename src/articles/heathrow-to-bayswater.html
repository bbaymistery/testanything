    <p class="fw_bold mb1 h2 blue">Journey Time</p>

    <p class="mb1">Heathrow airport to/from Bayswater is 16 miles so you should allow up to an hour to arrive to your
        Destination,
        There are 5 passenger terminals in Heathrow. Heathrow T4&amp;T5 is closer to Gatwick Airport than other
        terminals. As private taxi we are fastest way to travel between 2 airports.</p>


    <p class="fw_bold h2 mb1 blue">Meet and greet service.</p>


    <p class="">Once your flight lands, the passengers are guided of the plane and into the terminal area where they
        have to
        go
        to the Passport control area for the passport checking process, after the passport control process is
        complete
        then the passengers are whom have luggage are required to make their way to the luggage reclaim area,
        finally
        once they have collected their luggage/s then they walk out of the arrivals gate, this is the area where
        your
        driver will be waiting for you with a name board. Due to the increased number of passengers flying into the
        UK
        airports it may sometimes be difficult to spot your driver, if this is the case please do not worry and just
        give us a call and mention your reference number and we will locate him for you. Please note that if you do
        not
        see your driver this does not mean that he is not there, your driver is always guaranteed to be there for
        you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb1">Please note that the whole process can take upto anything from 15 minutes to 1 hour and even longer
        in some
        cases, it all depends on different factors such as where you are flying in from, what passport you hold etc.
