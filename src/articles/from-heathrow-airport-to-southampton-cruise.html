                style="margin-right: 10px;">If
            you’re going on holiday on a cruise
            ship, then chances are you will be departing from Southampton docks.&nbsp; Of course, if you’re planning
            on
            visiting the Isle of Wight then you will probably be going across the water with your car but if not,
            then I
            would recommend you read on.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Cruise operators out of Southampton include Royal Caribbean, P&amp;O,
            Celebrity
            Cruises and the famous Cunard line travelling to destinations in the Baltic, Mediterranean, Caribbean
            and
            North America.&nbsp; There are four cruise terminals or berths along two miles of coast in Southampton –
            the
            Queen Elizabeth II terminal, the City terminal, the Ocean terminal and the Mayflower terminal.</p>

<div class="container_center boxa">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are three principal ways of travelling to Southampton in order to
        board
        your ship – by coach or bus, by rail or by <a href="/southampton_cruise_taxi_transfers.aspx">private
            transfer</a>.&nbsp; The journey to Southampton from central London is about 80 miles in distance and
        travelling by coach is probably the cheapest route, i.e. with National Coaches, but it is also the
        slowest
        and will take approximately two and a half hours.&nbsp; There are some coach packages that will also
        stop
        off at tourist destinations en route, such as Stonehenge.&nbsp; However, there are certain drawbacks to
        travelling by coach.&nbsp; There is a limit to the amount of luggage you are allowed to take with
        you.&nbsp;
        European restrictions state only two cases are allowed in the coach’s hold and weighing no more than
        22kg
        (44lb).&nbsp; In addition, the coach doesn’t stop at the seaport but at a terminus a short distance
        away, so
        you will need to get a taxi to take you to right terminal.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Travelling by rail is another option and it is a quicker journey time than
        travelling by coach.&nbsp; However, you, again, have restrictions which are the same as you have for
        travelling by coach.&nbsp; In terms of luggage, you are limited by what you can not only carry, but also
        by
        how much space you will have on the train to store your luggage.&nbsp; There are no shuttle train
        services
        so you have to rely on everyday consumer trains, travelling with other members of the general public,
        and if
        you are having to travel during a rush hour period, then there will be even less space available for
        your
        luggage!&nbsp; As with coaches, the train station is a short distance away from the Southampton port
        terminals and requires a short taxi journey to the Southampton terminals.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">With both of these travel options, you also have the added headache of
        getting
        yourself from your home , hotel or from an airport if you have travelled down from another part of the
        country, to either the coach or rail terminus.&nbsp; In central London, the coach operates out of
        Victoria
        station, whilst with rail you can travel from Waterloo or, of course, from other regional rail
        stations.&nbsp; This will involve arranging a lift from friends, family or the hire of a taxi.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">The most flexible and easiest way of travelling to Southampton is by private
        car
        transfer. <a class="blue text_underline" href="/southampton_cruise_taxi_transfers">&nbsp;Heathrow
            Gatwick Transfers (HGT) </a>provide a comprehensive and personal private transfer service,
        collecting

    <p>From Heathrow to <a class="blue text_underline" href="/southampton_cruise_taxi_transfers"
            title="Southampton Cruise Terminal">Southampton</a> is roughly 65 miles, the journey duration
        can
        vary around 80 minutes. There are no straight journeys via public transport. At Southampton, 2 miles
        apart from one another, there are 4 cruise terminals. These can be difficult to reach and may
        increase
        the cost of your journey.</p>

        and
        we have the latest executive vehicles with experienced professional drivers to make your 65 mile
