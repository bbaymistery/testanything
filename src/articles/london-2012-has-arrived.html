    <p class="blue h1 fw_bold mb1">London 2012 has arrived, are you planning on escaping or staying for the games?</p>
    <p class="mb1">Well, the big event of this year has finally arrived, the London 2012 Olympics! And what excitement
        it is
        generating, particularly with the ringing of the bells to launch the London 2012 Festival. All the dedicated
        Olympic lanes are now open (these are a contractural requirement with the Olympic Committee) and after the
        initial confusion, traffic seems to be running more smoothly.</p>
    <p class="mb1">With the Olympics running over the traditional holiday period of August, there will be many of you
        who are
        departing the UK for holidays abroad. What is often a last minute consideration is your journey to and from the
        airport, or sea port if you are travelling by sea. There are, of course, a variety of options - public
        transport, coaches, taxis… then there’s a dedicated airport transfer service, and Heathrow Gatwick Transfers
        offers just this service for you.</p>
    <p class="mb1"><a class="blue text_underline" href="/">Heathrow Gatwick Transfers</a> provides a cost
        effective airport transfer service to Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and London City Airport, as well as a
        service to the sea ports, Southampton, Dover, Harwich and Portsmouth, starting from £49.00.</p>
    <p class="mb1"><a class="blue text_underline" href="/heathrow_terminal_1_taxi">Heathrow</a> is the UK’s
        largest airport, and is also the fourth busiest worldwide. Many travellers pass through Heathrow to catch a
        connecting flight to another airport, such as <a class="blue text_underline"
            href="/gatwick_airport_north_taxi_transfers">Gatwick</a>,
        Stansted or even further afield in the UK. Specialising in airport taxi transfers and providing a reliable
        service that removes all the hassle from your journey, Heathrow Gatwick Transfers is definitely the most
        convenient and comfortable way to travel. All customers are welcomed by one of our professional, personal
        chauffeurs within the airport by the arrival gates at no extra cost. In addition, we offer a free waiting
        service so should your flight be delayed for any reason, we won’t compound the situation and make it worse, we
        will wait for you. Need a child or baby seat? That’s no problem, and we don’t charge for it either, and there
        are no extra charges for payment by credit card, unlike some companies. Our cars are well maintained, regularly
        serviced and can accommodate up to 8 passengers, including 5 pieces of hand luggage and 8 check-in luggage bags.
    </p>
    <p class="mb1">In order to make your airport transfer as smooth as possible, we offer some tips to help you:</p>
    <ul class="mb1">
        <li class="liSquare"><span style='color:#6969ff '>&#9632;</span> As soon as you exit the plane, call Heathrow
            Gatwick Transfers and let us know. Your driver is then able to
            make sure he is at the arrivals gate ready for you.</li>
        <li class="liSquare"><span style='color:#6969ff '>&#9632;</span>If you are catching a connecting flight, advise
            passport control as they usually help fast-track passengers
            that are running on a tight schedule.</li>
        <li class="liSquare"><span style='color:#6969ff '>&#9632;</span>Collect any baggage as quickly as you can and
            then pass through HM Customs; our driver will meet you.</li>
        <li class="liSquare"><span style='color:#6969ff '>&#9632;</span>Confirm your connecting flight departure time at
            the destination airport.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is recommended that you allow a minimum of 4 hours between connecting flights which allows for any potential
        airport or road traffic delays.</p>
