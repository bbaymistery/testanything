    <h2 class="mb1 h2  fw_bold blue">Journey Time</h2>
    <p>Gatwick to Heathrow is approximately 45 miles so you should allow up to an hour to arrive to your
        Destination, There are 5 passenger terminals in Heathrow. Heathrow T4&amp;T5 is closer to Gatwick
        Airport
        than other terminals. As private taxi we are fastest way to travel between 2 airports.</p>
    <p>For travel information between Heathrow and Gatwick please visit our <a
            href="/from-heathrow-to-gatwick-travel">Heathrow-Gatwick
            Travel</a> page</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 class=" mb1 h2 fw_bold blue">Meet and greet service.</h2>
    <p>Once your flight lands, the passengers are guided of the plane and into the terminal area where they have
        to
        go to the Passport control area for the passport checking process, after the passport control process is
        complete then the passengers are whom have luggage are required to make their way to the luggage reclaim
        area, finally once they have collected their luggage/s then they walk out of the arrivals gate, this is
        the
        area where your driver will be waiting for you with a name board. Due to the increased number of
        passengers
        flying into the UK airports it may sometimes be difficult to spot your driver, if this is the case
        please
        do
        not worry and just give us a call and mention your reference number and we will locate him for you.
        Please
        note that if you do not see your driver this does not mean that he is not there, your driver is always
        guaranteed to be there for you.</p>
    <p>Please note that the whole process can take upto anything from 15 minutes to 1 hour and even longer in
        some
        cases, it all depends on different factors such as where you are flying in from, what passport you hold
        etc.

    <h2 class="fw_bold h2 mb1  blue">Ways to Travel from Heathrow to Gatwick/ Gatwick to Heathrow.</h2>
    <p>National Express Airport Transfer- Is the only DIRECT Bus in operation in between Heathrow and Gatwick, it
        takes
        approximately hour and a half from one airport to another. It runs to Gatwick South Terminal only but you
        may
        take a free monorail to the North Terminal, and it runs to Heathrow Airport Central Bus Station, which then
        you
        have to do a short walk to Terminals 1,2,3,4 and 5, it takes maximum of 15 minutes to check in desks
        depending
        on which terminal you are going from.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="fw_bold h2 mb1 blue">Taxi Services: Heathrow Gatwick Transfers</h2>
    <p>We run Services 24/7 365 days a year, pick up from either of the airports going to another takes approx. 45
        minutes unless you are travelling through the rush hour on a weekday (which is about 0700 to 0930, and 1630
        to
        1900) the time should be doubled, It’s also often bad around Saturday lunchtime too. Picking up from the
        Terminal<b>:</b>&nbsp;We offer a meet and greet service from inside the terminal at no extra cost, also 1
        hour
        free waiting time (the waiting time starts after the plane has landed). Dropping off to the Terminal: We
        will
        take you right inside the Terminal drop off point where the plane will be departing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="fw_bold h2 mb1 blue">Train Service:</h2>
    <p>Heathrow Express. It’s a fast train that goes to and from Heathrow airport. For the purposes of getting
        between
        Gatwick and Heathrow airports though, it’s essentially useless as it goes between Heathrow and Paddington in
        north west central London, from where it’s very difficult to get to and from Gatwick. So there you go, you
        can
        ignore any further nonsense about the Heathrow Express. This route though uses the Gatwick Express - a
        similar
        idea which goes from Gatwick.</p>
