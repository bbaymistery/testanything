        <p style="text-align: justify;">The London Olympics 2012 is, without doubt, going to attract an influx of
            people, principally via our airports up and down the UK.&nbsp; No-one can deny that an event of the
            magnitude of the Olympics is anything but good for industry and the country as a whole, however it will put
            a strain on our travel infrastructure, and this is what the UK’s leading airlines are concerned about.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Airlines, including British Airways, bmi, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic, have
            warned that our airports, and particularly London airports, will potentially suffer from disruption and
            severe delays unless action is taken to maintain regular scheduled flights, increase capacity and prevent
            disruption as much as possible.&nbsp; In the South East, London Heathrow is the world’s busiest
            international airport, closely followed by London Gatwick, with London Stansted and London Luton airports
            featuring in Europe’s ‘top 50’ of the busiest passenger airports.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">London Heathrow currently sees approximately 3,800 passengers fly in to the
            airport per hour; about the same number fly out, and London Gatwick isn’t far behind these figures.&nbsp; It
            is anticipated that air travel will increase, but so too will passenger traffic into the UK via our
            seaports, including Dover and Southampton, with many visitors and competitors to the Olympics travelling by
            car or van due to the need to transport equipment. <a href="/">Heathrow Gatwick Transfers</a> specialise in
            airport transfers between the four main south eastern airports, as well as covering journeys to and from our
            seaports.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Department for Transport (DfT) have stated that they “… are committed to
            delivering safe and efficient transport services for the London Olympic Games, and aviation is clearly a
            major part of this.”&nbsp; They have announced a series of special measures in order to preserve schedule
            air flights from disruption during the Games.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Licensed by PCO (Public Carriage Office), <a href="/">Heathrow Gatwick
                Transfers (HGT)</a> is able to
            arrange your travel between airports and seaports, ensuring that you arrive at your destination on time, in
            comfort and relaxed.&nbsp; <a href="/heathrow_terminal_4_taxi_transfers">HGT’s</a> airport
            transfer service provides a range of benefits including ‘meet and greet’, free waiting time and no credit
            card charges.&nbsp; We monitor your flights to make sure you arrive in plenty of time but do allow for
            check-in when booking your private chauffeur.&nbsp; Your journey is in safe hands, giving you peace of mind
            when it comes to your Olympics adventure.</p>
