    </p>
    <p class="mb1">According to a new Government report from the cross-party Silk Commission, the National Assembly for
        Wales should
        have the opportunity to ditch Air Passenger Duty (APD) on long-haul flights.&nbsp; The Silk Commission has
        recommended delegating a series of taxation powers to the Assembly, including APD on long-haul flights for
        passengers departing from British airports.</p>
    <p class="mb1">Cardiff International Airport issued a statement; “We welcome the report from the Silk Commission, in
        particular
        the recommendation to devolve responsibility for long-haul APD to Wales.&nbsp; The ability to control long-haul
        APD rates is just one tool in the armoury we have to improve air passenger services to and from Wales, and
        increase passenger traffic.”</p>
    <p class="mb1">Much criticised by industry personnel and the average British Family, as well as foreign
        holidaymakers to the
        British shores who have to pay the tax to return to their own country, thereby having a detrimental effect on
        the economies of countries that rely on tourism, this latest Government report will certainly heighten the UK’s
        overall campaign to have APD scrapped, particularly on long-haul flights out of the country.</p>
    <p class="mb1">After the recent rise in April of this year, a family of four flying to Europe now has to pay £52 in
        tax; if you
        are travelling to more far out countries, the US or the Caribbean, your tax bill could be as much as £324, or
        higher if you are visiting Australia… and that’s just Economy class!&nbsp; APD has a knock-on effect on
        airlines, too, who think twice before launching a new route.</p>
    <p class="mb1">APD has seriously affected passenger footfall through Britain’s regional airports; in 2006, 2 million
        passengers
        passed through Cardiff airport – APD was just £5 per person for flights to Europe, and £20 per person for
        countries outside of Europe; in 2011, 1.2 million passengers travelled via Cardiff airport… a significant
        reduction, however how much of that is due to the financial crisis from 2009 is not reported.</p>
    <p class="mb1">But the Silk Commission’s recommendations haven’t been so welcome from neighbouring airports, with
        the suggestion
        that a cut in APD would threaten jobs, growth and connectivity in the South West.&nbsp; Bristol Airport went as
        far as saying, “Even when restricted to direct long-haul flights, a price advantage in Wales would put vital
        services from nearby English airports to European hubs at risk and severely undermine the business case for
        long-haul services from Bristol to the USA and Middle East.”</p>
    <p class="mb1">Whatever the final outcome, without doubt the Commission’s report and recommendations and increased
        activity in
        the hornet’s nest!</p>
